0:00 Let's review what you've learned in each one of these apps. 
0:03 When I first introduced the apps I told you what you are going to learn 
0:06 but you had never seen it so you know, 
0:08 it probably didn't really resonate the way it will now. 
0:11 So let's go through and just kind of review really quickly 
0:13 and if you had to reinforce one of these concepts, 
0:15 just jump back to either the concept video from that app or the code, 
0:19 or play around with it some more. 
0:21 So in app 1, this was our simplest app, it was the Hello World app, 
0:25 remember, the goal was really to test your Python environment get your editor set up, 
0:30 things like that, not really to prove that you can write print hello world, that's silly, right. 
0:34 So, we sort of introduced PyCharm here,
0:37 we talked about variables, strings, and accepting user input 
0:41 and this was really sort of getting our feet wet, getting started. 
0:44 Next app was, what I kind of considered our first real app,
0:47 that's Guess That Number Game, and remember, 
0:50 the computer randomly select a number between 0 and 100 
0:53 and then it would tell the user hey, you are too high, too low, as it took in the guesses. 
0:56 So in order to do that, we had to understand boolean conditions, 
1:00 we had if, else, elif statement, while loops 
1:03 and when we start talking about these concepts like if else statements and while loops 
1:09 we have to talk about the shape of a Python program 
1:11 and here we learned about the white space and indentation 
1:14 and how the smart editors help with that, 
1:16 we also talked about string formatting with the curly braces 
1:19 to sort of generate strings in a much nicer and more flexible way, 
1:22 and we got the very basics of functions go in there as well. 
1:26 App 3, When Is My Birthday this one was all about dates, times and time spans, 
1:30 now these can be tricky in Python so I made this special app
1:34 just to help you become comfortable with those 
1:36 and sort of reinforce what we learned in the first two apps. 
1:39 App number 4 was our Journal or a daily diary and this was pretty big, 
1:44 we covered a lot of stuff, this was our first sort of major app I would say. 
1:48 And, because it was a bigger app we actually broke our code into multiple files, 
1:53 we had our journal, module, and we had our main program.py 
1:56 and we had those work together, we did a lot of file I/O and to facilitate that 
2:00 we did path management and in OS independent way using you know, 
2:05 not surprising the OS.path; we used for in loops and iterators, 
2:08 obviously playing a key role in the for in loops, 
2:11 because we had these different files, 
2:13 we might want to reuse the methods and features of one of those modules, 
2:17 and if we have been just calling main, 
2:21 or just writing our code directly, like write in line there, 
2:24 we wouldn't be able to import those, 
2:26 so we talked about the dunder name convention, 
2:28 to differentiate between when your program itself is being run 
2:32 and when your script is being reused. 
2:35 Also we talked about documenting your own code with docstrings.
2:38 App number 5, this was our weather forecast app 
2:41 and we went out to weather underground 
2:43 and we grabbed the html and we did that using a technique called screen scraping 
2:47 by making an http request, using the request package pulling that down, 
2:51 taking the html, send it off to the BeautifulSoup package 
2:54 and then writing css selectors against that in memory 
2:58 to actually pull out the data we want. 
3:00 In order to get Requests and BeautifulSoup, which are external packages, 
3:04 we used pip and we could further isolate our particular environment in our application 
3:11 using virtual environments. 
3:13 Along the way I also got to introduce you to a very Pythonic concept called slicing.
3:16 App 6, I hope this one made you laugh, this was the Lol Cat Factory, 
3:21 And this was all about consuming services and working with binary data, 
3:25 so recall, we went out to our lol cat service, 
3:27 we downloaded a bunch of binary images, and we saved them to the file system 
3:32 and then we used Python to subprocess capability 
3:34 to launch the finder or folder browser explorer depending on your os, 
3:40 we'd launch that up to actually show the UI 
3:43 since we are not diving into things like PyQt and so on. 
3:47 App number 7 was our Dungeon and Dragons Style Wizard Game,
3:50 this was one of my favorites and this one is about 
3:52 a very core concept in modern programming 
3:55 and Python classes, inheritance, things like that. 
3:59 So we talked about how you create classes, 
4:01 and model your data structures with classes, 
4:04 and inheritance allows us to sort of separate that into layers, 
4:06 so it's more reusable, more manageable Python has magic methods, 
4:10 sometimes are referred to as dunder methods, like __init__(), __str__(), 
4:15 for overwriting behaviors of our classes, 
4:18 our objects for example we can write the __init__()
4:21 to take control over the creation and initialization of our objects, 
4:24 and speaking of initialization, we saw when we are doing inheritance 
4:28 that you need to be careful about chaining these together in the correct order 
4:33 so the whole hierarchy get setup correctly. 
4:35 Typically, this is where you define your fields and these __init__() methods 
4:39 and when we are using our objects you don't have static typing in Python, 
4:44 instead we use something called duck typing to achieve polymorphism. 
4:47 In application 8, we built a file searcher app and we got to feed a ton of data to it, 
4:53 remember we had our 2.27GB of text what we were searching with this thing, 
4:58 so in order to make that much more performant and efficient 
5:02 we used generator methods using the yield and yield return keywords, 
5:07 and because we were trying to process a hierarchy, a tree of data, the file structure, 
5:13 we used recursion which models that scenario very well. 
5:17 In app 9, we got hold of that comma separated value data 
5:23 on the Sacramento real estate market in 2008 I believe it was. 
5:27 And we loaded that up, we did all sorts of interesting processing on it, 
5:31 we saw that at the heart of Python are dictionaries, 
5:34 and dictionaries of course played a key role in our comma separated value processing as well; 
5:39 we wanted to sort the data that we got back out of that file 
5:41 and we did that by passing a method 
5:44 we saw that methods were first class objects in Python, 
5:48 and when you want to write really small concise ones, it's much better to use 
5:52 a lambda method or lambda expression rather than creating a method somewhere else 
5:56 and just so that you can pass the name in where you are. 
5:59 We talked about the csv file format and how Python has built in support for processing that,
6:03 we also saw that we can run into a situation 
6:06 where Python 2 and Python 3 behave differently, 
6:09 remember we had the statistics module that's in Python 3.3 and above 
6:13 but not in Python 2 so we wrote special code 
6:15 to sort of do a polyfil or fill in that missing piece for Python 2 
6:20 and the consumers further down in our app didn't have to worry 
6:24 about whether there was the statistics module 
6:27 we introduced a less efficient but sufficient one for them to use. 
6:30 we also saw that many of those situations that are solved with loops and lists,
6:34 so looping over a bunch of data, doing some tests, things like that, 
6:40 can be solved much more concisely with list comprehensions. 
6:43 And while solving problems with lists is great, 
6:46 in app 8 we saw the performance implications 
6:48 that you can run into if you are processing a lot of data in a pipeline. 
6:52 So, in app 8 we used generator methods, 
6:55 there is a similar concept in this comprehension style called generator expressions 
7:00 so we use those generator expressions to create efficient data pipelines. 
7:04 The last app we built was app number 10, The Movie Search App. 
7:09 This went out to the open movie database api and it pulled back data.
7:13 And that was interesting, we were processing json and things like that, 
7:16 but the key focus of this app was to build reliable code. 
7:22 When you have a network based code 
7:24 chances that the network is down are pretty good, 
7:27 especially if you are running on a client machine 
7:29 like a laptop where it could be out of wi-fi range or whatever. 
7:32 So we need to be able to handle those errors 
7:34 we introduced the try except block to do that,we also saw that you can use multiple except blocks
7:39 to handle errors by type, remember, put them both specific one first the most general one last, 
7:44 we also talked about validating arguments by raising errors;
7:48 we had some kind of argument pass doing init method for a class 
7:52 the init method doesn't have a return value 
7:55 that you can pass back and say false or none or something like this,
7:58 but we still want to validate the arguments coming in 
8:01 and so we saw that we could raise an exception when invalid data was passed 
8:05 and then the object would never even be created unless it started out in a valid state.
